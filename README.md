NOTE: new description for version 2.2 is comming soon 

---

## Old description 
Adds a UI element that lets you select certain items and see production/consumption rates for those items.

It allows you to have up to ~~15 slots~~ 50 slots and 2 columns and see production/consumption rates for 5s, 1m, 10m, 1h and 10h intervals.

The UI element is freely draggable across your screen.

You can also minimize and expand it at any point.

NEW: The UI has a auto-hide featuer so can place it without problems below the map (where the tooltips appear)

## Improvements 

- can be used as second instance to Tiny Production UI
- more slots
- 2 columns
- placeable below the map (auto hide)

## Motivation

The motivation to create a new mod was to have a second UI panel,  
first a simple clone, then more and more improved / adapted to my needs.

## Credits

Thanks to [janisvepris](https://mods.factorio.com/user/janisvepris) for his mod [Tiny Production UI](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/tiny-production-ui) (MIT) which served as a foundation for the new improvements.
